# Project Tarot Scripts
### Written by Kade Hasenfus

## Description:
These scripts in of themselves are not a complere project.
They are simply part of a group project, Operation Tarot, a IM2 student project at UML in Spring 2021, made in Unity for VR.

### Note:
Because I simply made a repo out of the scripts folder, a folder inside of the unity project folder,
all .meta files can be completely ignored, as these are just files auto-generated by unity whenever a file (of the same name) is created.
Therefore, they are irrelevant to the project, and otherwise of little to no noteworthiness.
